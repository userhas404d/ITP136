# Robot Rat

C# application that controls the movements of a robot car around a floor.

The robot car will move about a "floor" represented by a two-dimensional array.
The robot car has a paint sprayer attached to its rear fender. As the car moves about the floor it will leave a mark if the sprayer is on but not if the sprayer is off.

- [x] The floor array may be of type bool (boolean) or any other type you deem appropriate.

Control the robot car with a simple text-based menu.
Your menu should also allow a user to

- [x] make the car turn right, turn left and move forward a number of spaces.
- [x] turn the paint sprayer (Pen) on or off
- [x] print the floor pattern
- [x] and exit the application.
- [x] Each time you move the car forward print the floor to show the car's progress.
